and record when their exams are.<br />

## Introduction

As outlined in the assessment brief the goal of this project is to make a single web page application that
helps support students at Solent University.

In assessment 1 I discussed many ideas for projects that could help students in their day-to-day life, but i discovered that at University we are catered too very well. Especially in modern society technology makes day to day life extremely easy so having to design a new application that would benefit students always felt like a challenge to me. 

In the end I decided to look at applications that people use in jobs to help keep track progress and planning as those are two key values of every academic’s life.

I believed that bringing in planning apps such as Slack or Trello into the university life at Solent University would benefit students as they would be unique to the university and would save students the extra hassle in downloading an extra app on their phone.
My proposal was to suggest that a planning application clone like Trello or slack could be implemented into the Solent university app.

## Methodology

The assessment brief states that a methodology should be used to help design the thought process of this project. The methodology recommended was to use a nonlinear process in design thinking which essentially means to Empathise with users, Define the problems, ideate (create solution), Prototype the solution, and finally test the prototype to see if it solves the problem and pleases the users. This idea of thinking is generally good practice however when I started designing the application, I struggled to use the thought process to its full advantage simply because my idea was too primitive in design.

Another setback I found was that the methodology recommended was that it requires heavily on user feedback, and I do agree this idea however after interviewing fellow students it seemed to draw to the same issue as I discussed earlier that students in modern society have an abundance if resources and technology makes it even easier and quicker for people to access whatever they desire.

Due to those issues I encountered and poor time management skills that I had to go with a different methodology. I approached the first assignment in a more Data Science manor and tried to understand how the Solent University platform already works. I first studied the website and tried to look for consistencies within each webpage, I would then go to replicate these consistency’s design styles to keep within the Solent University design philosophy. I then researched into the Solent University app to gain an understanding of how the app functioned differently on a mobile device compared to a computer.

I then decided to draw out wireframes and make a prototype within Figma.

## Brief Summary of the development of the project

The project only focuses on two components, number 1 being the navigation bar which can be toggled from the side of the screen. The navigation bar has been designed to be as similar to the Solent university platform, so it blends in. I did this by incorporating Links to other University devices that already exist such as the Solent Portal and Student Timetable.
This practice can also be seen in the Footer component which is an inspired design of the footer from the Solent University portal web page. The Solent University Logo as also been implemented in the header to give the aesthetic that this application could be used as part of the Solent university platform.

The second main component was the creating and deleting notes/ recording tasks tickets dynamically. This would allow the user to theoretically use the app to take notes in class and record important information such as exam dates, where the exam room will be, what exam chair they will be sat in. This component could easily be expanded upon if development was to go further for example features such as a timer to remind students to take a break when studying or to send them push to remind them to study or when an exam in near.

Throughout the project's life cycle, I followed an agile development methodology in constantly designing a component and then testing thoroughly to see if it performed correctly. In total the navigation bar on the side of the screen has been design 4 different times and the creation/ deletion of the note mechanic has been implemented twice.


## Conclusion/Results

Overall I’m pleased with the consistency throughout development as the Figma prototype is very similar to the react prototype which means I was sticking to my previous plans in a structured way and confirms that my originally planning although might be simple did prove to be effective within development.

One key methodology I’ve over the years of developing applications is that its incredibly easy to dream big and try to make an ambitious product where in fact almost most of the time it’s always worth making a project that seems incredibly easy to make.

To expand on my previous statement my designs for this project was simplistic and although it may have seemed boring at times it did feel like the sensible choice, especially for having to develop alone.
This project did challenge at parts, I have found that my weakness lies in how a web page is structured from each component, but my strengths are more persistent in the theory of how a component works which would suggested my background would be more suited for a back-end developer role rather than a front-end developer role.

If I planned my time better, I would have used Firebase to expand me
project as I felt just using GitHub pages limited my app to a static page format and considering my app is meant to record notes and exam times having use of a database system would be a key part in taking the app further and being more useful to the user.
